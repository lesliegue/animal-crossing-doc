        <p>Snow finally begins sticking to the ground in Animal Crossing: New Horizons (ACNH) today for the Northern Hemisphere bringing a completely snow covered landscape to our islands, alongside brand new recipes to collect!</p>

<p>Before even exploring the new features, it’s worth taking a moment to just enjoy how absolutely beautiful Animal Crossing: New Horizons looks during the snow-covered period. It’s not just the grass but the buildings, trees, buildings, bushes, and even fences!</p>

<p>During this Winter Snow Season, newer players can look forward to experiencing features like catching Snowflakes and building Snowboys for the first time. Meanwhile, veteran players can enjoy brand new DIY Recipes introduced in November 2021’s Version 2.0 Update! This article will cover everything new for both audiences.</p>
        <code>Make sure to check this page every once in a while to look for more updates.</code>

      <article>
        <p>As you explore your island covered in gorgeous snow for the very first time, be on the look out for any Snowflakes flying in the air around you! Similarly to both Cherry Blossom Petals and Maple Leaves, these Snowflakes can be found all winter long until late February when the snow disappears. Give your Net a swing to catch a Snowflake and keep it for crafting brand new Winter Snowflake DIY crafting recipes, like the Falling-Snow Wall and Snowflake Pochette. If you’re having trouble finding Snowflakes, be on the listen for a little twinkling sound when nearby one.</p>

        <p>What’s all of that fresh snow good for if you can’t do anything with it?! Make sure to search your Animal Crossing: New Horizons island every day during the Winter Snow Season looking for any mysterious new Snowballs!
          If you spot a Snowball, look nearby to find its twin and start kicking them around in the snow until they can be rolled into even larger sizes. And if you push them together, you can build a full-fledged Snowman!

Spend some time trying to judge the perfect proportions of head and body sizes for your Snowballs and you’ll be rewarded handsomely.It’s worth your time as building a Perfect Snowman will reward you with a special Large Snowflake crafting material and an exclusive Snowboy DIY Recipe!</p>

      <article>
        <p>There’s one last little detail to enjoy with the new snow in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, or should we say little bug — the Dung Beetle!

Although the Dung Beetle technically is introduced on December 1st, you can only find him rolling on Snowballs, so the 11th of December is the real first sighting of this sneaky bug.
          Notably, players in the Northern Hemisphere who have been catching every single bug since March in real-time can now complete their Bug Critterpedia for the very first time! Congratulations if you’re one of them!</p>
        <code> Pssst, same as other insects, running towards them scares them away, so be careful and quiet in order to catch them.</code>

        <p>If you’re lucky, you might learn a new Snowflake Wreath DIY recipe from Isabelle during her morning announcements today as she discusses the new Snowflakes seen on your island.
          There’s two different seasonal conversations that Isabelle has to offer during this season though, so if you get the one about Snowballs first today, you won’t receive the Snowflake Wreath yet.

No need to worry though — you can hear about the Snowflakes and get the free DIY recipe from Isabelle at a later date, or even just unlock the recipe yourself through shooting down Balloon Presents instead.</p>
